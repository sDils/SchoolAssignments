					<h1>Regular Pieces</h1>
					
					<ul id="regPieces">
						<li>Each player starts with 12 regular pieces on each of the black squares of the first three rows on their side.</li>
				   		<li>One player's regular pieces are black. The other player's regular pieces are red.</li>
				   </ul>
				   
				   <h2> Kings </h2>
				   
				   <ul>
					   <li>No players start with kings.</li>
					   <li>The color of kings are the same as regular pieces, but they generally look bigger or fancier.</li>
					   <li>Placing a regular piece on the opposing player's first row turns it into a king.</li>
				   </ul>
				   
				   <h2>How to Play!</h2>
					<ul id="howTo">
						<li>Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs. (Typically, one set of pieces is black and the other red.)</li>
						<li>The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark and 32 light squares. It is positioned so that each player has a light square on the right side corner closest to him or her.</li>
						<li>Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.</li>
						<li>Black moves first. Players then alternate moves.</li>
						<li>Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).</li>
						<li>A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.</li>
						<li>A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.</li>
						<li>When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.</li>
						<li>If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.</li>
						<li>When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king. One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.</li>
						<li>Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)
						<li>Kings may combine jumps in several directions -- forward and backward -- on the same turn. Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</li>
						<li>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. In most cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.</li>
